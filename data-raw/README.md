`hector_template.ini` is the file used to create new Hector .ini files for RCMIP scenarios. It was created by replacing string literals in the default Hector `hector_rcp45.ini` file with placeholder strings. The functions that create new .ini files locate these placeholder strings and replace them with strings corresponding to the given scenario.
