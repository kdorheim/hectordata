This directory holds the raw data and the scripts required to generate the CMIP6 ini and emission csv files. The CMIP6 emissions and concentration inputs for simplel climate models come from the RCMIP (https://www.rcmip.org/). Note there is a fair amount of processing that must take place before the RCMIP inputs can be read into Hector.
